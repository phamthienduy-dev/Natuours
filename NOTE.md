# Note

In Express, everything is middleware

Each router is kind of mini sub-application, one for each resource

Static file: files that are in the file system but we can not access using all routes

Mongoose is all about models, it's just the blueprint that we use to create documents

We can create models out of Mongoose Schema

Test to work with git
